DO NOT COPY the build/target/product/core.mk as-is to your tree.
Just copy the following from it:
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
...
    libopersysnativemgriface \
    libopersysnativeservice \
    opersysnativeservice
...

You can run the system service on your target by doing this:
# opersysnativeservice &

You can use this to check that it runs:
# service list

You can then call on it directly:
# service call opersysnativeservice 1 i32 2313423
or
# service call opersysnativeservice 2 i32 12341351
And you can then use logcat to check that the call went through:
....
D/OpersysNativeService(  877): *************** writeValue() called with value 12341351 *******************
...
